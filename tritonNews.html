    <h2>Triton News Website</h2>
    <img src="images/CaseStudies/TritonNews/TNNProtoHome.png" class="responsive image-border" style="width: 80%;">
    <p>
      A design team was looking for people to redesign a website for UCSD and global news that would catered primarily to students but keeping in mind of the general population.
      <br></br>
      I first started with outlining the steps I believe were needed to create a feasible website design for Triton News Network. So I needed to do user research. As a person who 
      doesn't follow news in general, and especially TNN, I started with researching what exactly TNN was, what their demographic was, and what type of information were they discussing. 
      Afterwards, I looked into the TNN’s targets users’ actions and opinions on a UCSD news website, <a href="https://www.triton.news">The Triton</a>, to see what components the target users’ liked and disliked. With this 
      information, I then created target user personas for the new TNN website. For my last step, I designed the website, first as a sketch, then a wireframe, then as a prototype.
      <br></br>
      This was a great learning experience in designing my first news website. I was able to hone my skills in the design process of doing background research, conducting surveys, 
      and especially using Figma for prototyping. This case study made me really think about how news information should be received. For example, what information is first seen and 
      what information gets the user to read an article.

    <h3>1. Background Research</h3>
    <p>So first off, I learned through Facebook and Google that TNN isn’t an already existent news website, but is rather a news television show that was produced by Triton TV. 
      The show was founded in 2010, whose mission according to Facebook is “to provide UCSD students with the best and most up to date news.” Their show was made primarily of youtube 
      videos of around 5 minutes long and discussed current and future events. Unfortunately, they only uploaded 5 videos, the most recent video uploaded on February 19, 2015.
      <br></br>
      Based on the Facebook mission statement and from their description on Youtube,  “Welcome to TNN, a show dedicated to the latest news around UCSD, La Jolla, and the student body. 
      A show for Tritons, by Tritons, produced by Triton TV!,” I understood that their intended audience is primarily targeted to UCSD students, but also potentially others, including 
      alumni and students’ families.
      <br></br>
      ​Adding this information to the challenge prompt of creating a website that “delivers a new value to users in learning more about this brave new world,” and that focuses “on the 
      larger and growing millennial audience, including those outside of the student demographic”, I figured that the stakeholders, UCSD students and non-UCSD students, need a website 
      that looks at both local, global, and UCSD news in a way that is engaging to the more tech-exposed user of today’s tech era. <a href="https://www.triton.news">The Triton</a>, an existing UCSD news website, was a 
      source I could expand on or take inspiration from in making my design. As of this redesign, they have updated their website.
